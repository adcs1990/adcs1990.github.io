# LitElement Deployment Test

This project contains a development test developed in JavaScript using the Lit-Element framework.
It's a simple game based in the traditional rock, paper and scissors game.

## Explanation

I have developed the project as abstractly as possible, separating by modules and preparing the classes for testing. I have tried to use all the power that lit-element offers for this task.

```bash
npm i
